The raptor6.pd patch implements an experimental arpeggiator program based on the mathematical music theories of my dear friend, the contemporary composer Clarence Barlow. This is already the 6th iteration of this program, now ported to Lua so that it can be run easily with any Pd version. Compared to earlier versions, it also features much cleaner source code and some other noticeable improvements under the hood. We recommend running this patch with [Purr Data][], Jonathan Wilkes' modern Pd flavor, as it has all the required externals including Pd-Lua on board, and the layout of the GUI has been optimized for that version. But the patch should also work fine in "vanilla" [Pd][] if you have the [Pd-Lua][] and [Zexy][] externals installed (a version of Pd-Lua for Lua 5.3 or later is required, you can find this under the given URL). The screenshot below shows the patch running in Purr Data.

A few sample presets are included in the presets folder, use the `p` abstractions in the lower right corner of the main patch to switch between these (or create your own). The main patch also has some controls to change meter and tempo, as well as an abundance of other parameters controlling the algorithm in the `panel` subpatch. If you need a whole band of Raptors to accompany you, multiple instances of the main patch can be run in concert in a single Pd instance. Just make sure that you select one of the instances as the time master (`M` toggle in the "time" subpatch) which happens automagically if you press the big green `play` toggle in one of the instances.

Raptor is quite advanced as arpeggiators go, it's really a full-blown algorithmic composition tool, although it offers the usual run-of-the-mill deterministic and random arpeggios as well. But the real magic starts when you turn on `raptor` mode and start playing around with the parameters in the panel. Documentation still needs to be written. The algorithm behind Raptor is briefly sketched out in my [ICMC 2006 paper][] (cf. Section 8), but for the time being you'll also have to dive into the source code and read Barlow's article in the [Ratio book][] if you'd like to get a deeper understanding of how the algorithm works.

Using the patch is easy enough, however. Hook up your MIDI keyboard and synthesizer to Pd's MIDI input and output, respectively, press `play` and just play some chords. Most of the time, I'm using Raptor with a MIDI guitar setup and a [Nektar PACER][] foot pedal, so the patch is somewhat geared towards that use case, but it also works fine with any MIDI keyboard and a free software synth such as [Qsynth][].

This project is still work in progress. There's some stuff on the TODO list, such as MIDI clock sync, OSC bindings for all the parameters, and a looper facility. The included presets also need some work, but hey, they're free. ;-) Feel free to use and modify them for whatever purpose. Bug reports and other contributions are welcome, and please do send me links to music produced with Raptor!

## Control

All of Raptor's parameters have MIDI bindings, so they can be automatized, e.g., in a DAW. For live performance, the patch contains a control subpatch for the PACER, and I've also included my modified PACER setup in case you want to use it, please check the pacer subfolder for details. If you use a different controller, you can modify the `control` subpatch to make it work for you. This is by no means required, though -- all the various switches and parameters can also be controlled with the GUI of the main patch, or by using the MIDI bindings listed in the table below.

**NOTE:** In the following table, *PC* refers to "program change", *CC* to "control change" messages. Like any MIDI input in Raptor, these are only received on the MIDI input channel (`in` numbox) set in the panel, which can be zero to denote "omni", i.e., receive on all MIDI channels.

The table lists the range of parameters. For "discrete" controls (0-1 or 0-n switches), the control value is taken as is, and any value greater than the number of alternatives is clamped to the given range. In particular, for 0-1 switches, *any* positive value means "on". For other ("continuous") controls the full 0-127 MIDI range is mapped to the parameter range, and a CC value of 64 denotes the middle of the range (which means zero for parameters with a bipolar range). 0-100 ranges generally denote percentages, i.e., dividing by 100 gives the real value used internally by the algorithm. Some parameters denote bias values ranging from -100 to +100% which are used for automatic modulation of other parameters according to pulse strengths in the chosen meter (a *positive* bias means that the value of the dependent parameter increases for *stronger* and decreases for *weaker* pulses, and vice versa for *negative* bias; a *zero* bias means that the parameter does *not* vary with pulse strength at all).
