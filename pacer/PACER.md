# PACER Setup

**NOTE:** While the controls discussed below can be used from a DAW, they are really designed for live performance. All Raptor parameters also have bindings better suited for MIDI automation, please see the Control section in the toplevel README file for details.

The [Nektar PACER][] makes for a great hands-free controller for live performances with Raptor, especially if you're playing MIDI guitar. This directory contains my custom PACER setup for Raptor, raptor-D1-3.syx, consisting of modified presets D1-D3 (these are the only presets contained in the sysex dump). You can load these into the PACER using FranÃ§ois Georgy's web-based [PACER Editor][], or any sysex librarian such as [SimpleSysexxer][].

The three presets are based on the A1, D2, and D3 factory presets of the PACER, but have quite a few modifications (and different names). They provide the following functions within Raptor (the actual CCs are subject to change and are not listed here; you can find them in Raptor's `control` subpatch if needed):

- **D1 (R1PRE):** program changes (PC1-6), these recall presets 1-6 of the arpeggiator
- **D2 (R2MOD):** switches 1-4 are toggles, 5+6 are triggers (momentary switches), assigned as follows:
    - switches 1+2 (down/up) change the octave range (+1 down/up), switch 3, when activated, adds another octave
    - switch 4 (mod shift) and switch 5 (mod) together control whatever parameter is assigned with the "mod-switch" control in the main patch, see below for details
    - switch 6 triggers "play", turning the arpeggiator on or off; unlike the other switches, this trigger is always received by the Raptor instance which currently acts as the time master (i.e., the instance which has the "M" toggle engaged in its `time` subpatch; note that only one instance can be the time master at any one time)
- **D3 (R3ARP):** switches 1-6 select the different arpeggiator modes (random, up, down, up-down, down-up, outside-in); switch 6, when long-pressed (>= 500 ms), toggles "raptor" mode (a very long press >= 1000 ms cancels the operation)
- **EXP1+2:** These refer to the two expression pedals which can be hooked up to the EXP1 and EXP2 sockets on the back of the PACER. They are unchanged from the PACER's factory settings and work in all three presets. In Raptor, EXP1 (CC7) controls the input gain of the velocity tracker, while EXP2 (CC11), like R2MOD switch 5, controls the mod parameter and enables continuous changes of whatever parameter is assigned with the "mod-switch" control. The latter control is also bound to CC1 (the modulation wheel), so that you can also modify the parameter on your MIDI keyboard.
- **FS1+2:** These refer to foot switches such as a sustain pedal plugged into the FS1 and FS2 sockets on the back of the PACER. D1-D3 all have FS1 and FS2 set to CC64 and CC67 which are bound to the "hold" and "mute" functions of the arpeggiator, respectively. Note that many MIDI keyboards also have a socket for CC64 at least, so that you can also invoke the "hold" function from your keyboard if needed.

**The mod-switch control:** In preset D2 (R2MOD), switch 5 (mod) toggles whatever parameter is assigned using the "mod-switch" control in the main patch. Switch 4 (mod shift), when engaged, reverses the polarity of the change (going down if the unshifted control goes up, and vice versa). The selected parameter can also be changed continuously using EXP2 in any preset, see above. Currently the available mod-switch options are velmod, pmod, gate, gatemod, and swing, which change the corresponding panel value, as well as sweep and autosweep which control the harmonicity sweep effect in the `harm-sweep` subpatch. The sweep option lets you change harmonicity and/or preference manually using switch 5 or the EXP2 pedal, going down by default and up if switch 4 (mod shift) is engaged. The autosweep option simply triggers the automatic sweep as configured in the `harm-sweep` subpatch (here it doesn't make a difference whether switch 4 is engaged or not). Finally, the "off" option completely disables the mod-switch control, which is sometimes useful when running multiple Raptor instances in concert.

**Keyboard operation:** As already mentioned above, the "mod" and "hold" parameters have bindings to the standard CC1 (modulation wheel) and CC64 (sustain pedal) controls, which will give you at least some minimal controls for live performance on your MIDI keyboard when using Raptor without the PACER.
