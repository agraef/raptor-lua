- better presets (port some more presets from Raptor 5 or even version 4?)

- OSC control (don't hold your breath)

- allow loop import/export from/to MIDI?

- other time sync protocols?

  Ableton Link seems most interesting, is this supported in Pd yet?

- do something useful with meter subdivisions?

  Our implementation of Barlow indispensabilities snipped from meter.pd_lua
  supports fractional pulses to subdivide the meter into tuplets (up to
  septuplets) on the fly. This isn't used in Raptor right now, but seems such
  a useful feature, so it would be nice to support it in some way. But how?
