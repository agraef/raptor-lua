- better presets (port some more presets from Raptor 5 or even version 4?)

- in the current implementation, presets (p abstractions) *must* be inserted
  in the main patch so that they know which Raptor instance to send their
  parameter values to; is there a better way to do this?

- OSC control (don't hold your breath)

- allow loop import/export from/to MIDI?

- other time sync protocols?

  Ableton Link seems most interesting, is this supported in Pd yet?

- do something useful with meter subdivisions? ratchets maybe?

  Our implementation of Barlow indispensabilities from meter.pd_lua supports
  fractional pulses to subdivide the meter into tuplets (up to septuplets) on
  the fly. This isn't used in Raptor right now, but seems such a useful
  feature, so it would be nice to support it in some way. But how?

- better harmonicity control

  Maybe we should use a logarithmic control for these, as the interesting
  harmonicity thresholds are all crowded together in the bottom 21% of the
  range. This would certainly make those controls easier to use, but will be a
  rather disruptive change and impact backward compatibility with old presets.
