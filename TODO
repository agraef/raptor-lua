- better presets (port some Raptor 5 presets?)

- OSC control

- when running multiple Raptors in concert, allow switching the PACER to each
  individual instance no matter what MIDI input channels they are on

- do something useful with meter subdivisions?

  Our implementation of Barlow indispensabilities snipped from meter.pd_lua
  supports fractional pulses to subdivide the meter into tuplets (up to
  septuplets) on the fly. This isn't used in Raptor right now, but seems such
  a useful feature, so it would be nice to support it in some way. But how?
